## Key Risks Identified

1. **Negative Funding Periods:** 12.8% of all periods have negative funding. Extended bearish sentiment can lead to consecutive losses.

2. **Liquidation Risk:** If using leverage on the perpetual short, a rapid BTC pump (>50%) could liquidate the position before funding profits accumulate.

3. **Exchange Risk:** Keeping funds on centralized exchanges exposes capital to hacks, insolvency, or withdrawal restrictions.

4. **Execution Risk:** Slippage during entry/exit can erode profits. Market orders in volatile conditions may get worse fills.

5. **Basis Risk:** Spot and perpetual prices may diverge temporarily, causing mark-to-market losses even if delta-neutral.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Start with 1x leverage** on perpetual to survive 100%+ pumps
2. **Use $15,270+** total capital for $10,000 exposure
3. **Monitor funding rates** during extreme market conditions
4. **Set stop-loss** if cumulative drawdown exceeds 10%
5. **Diversify across exchanges** (Binance, OKX) to reduce counterparty risk
